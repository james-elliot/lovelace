# Lovelace

LOVELACE version 1
18 May 2006
This is a chess engine xboard compatible written in full ADA
with some lines of assembly code.
It is bitboard based and uses extensively ADA representation clauses
Endgames are terrible.
Draws by repetion are not detected correctly.
The evaluation function is very bad (and very short..)
Use at your own risk...
